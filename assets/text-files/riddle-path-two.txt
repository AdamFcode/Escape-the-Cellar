
Mind your eyes here. 
This garish room can blind. 
See now the man in the orange suit? 
With the question marks? 
And the cane? 
Seems rather… 
Derivative. 
But he is dangerous. 
He offers safe passage. 
If you answer his riddle correctly. 
Listen now as he asks…
“If there are three apples and you take two, how many apples do you have?”

1. I have two apples.
2. Give me all the apples!
