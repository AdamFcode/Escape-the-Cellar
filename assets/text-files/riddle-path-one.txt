
Mind your eyes here. 
This garish room can blind. 
See now the man in the orange suit? 
With the question marks? 
And the cane? 
Seems rather… 
Derivative. 
But he is dangerous. 
He offers safe passage. 
If you answer his riddle correctly. 
Listen now as he asks…
“What is as big as an elephant, but weighs nothing?”

1. An Elephant’s shadow?
2. Your own dreams and aspirations?
