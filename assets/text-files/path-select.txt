
We commend your bravery.
Allow us to illuminate this room. 
This cold, stony, mildewy roomâ€¦ 
As you see, there is a door to your right.
It leads upwards. 
And one to your left which leads downwards. 
But which leads you to the outside? 
Choose carefully.

1. Upwards ought to lead me to the surface!
2. Downwards is as good a path as any!
