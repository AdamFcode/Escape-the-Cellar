Mind your head as you come to the end of the stairs. 
See; this room is much like the last. 
Except for one thing. 
The giant Troll blocking your path! 
And it spots you. 
Oh dear. 
Here it comes now, three times your size. 
It’s raising its club… 
How are you going to avoid this clobber?

1. Scurry up its side and grab the club!
2. Slide through its legs!
3. Prepare your hardest punch!
