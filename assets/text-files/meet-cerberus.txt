
Apologies for this hellish den of heat. 
Shield your eyes, but not too much. 
Here it comes. 
It bounds towards you from flames. 
It’s a giant, three-headed dog! 
The demonic creature lunges towards you. 
What are you going to do?

1. Yell “Sit boy” at the top of your lungs.
2. Hands up. Palms out. “Good boy…”
3. Quickly pinch each neck and hiss.
