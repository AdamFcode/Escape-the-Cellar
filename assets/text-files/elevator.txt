
There’s a reason this room is so small. 
It’s just one sliding door. 
To an elevator! 
Scramble on in. 
Observe the panel. 
It has two buttons. 
Each is labelled. 
We leave you this last choice, little one. 
Which do you choose?

1. The one labelled “Freedom”
2. The one labelled “Freedomer”
