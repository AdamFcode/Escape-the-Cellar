
Sorry about the smell in the next room. 
See that vile creature, mixing things in a cauldron? 
It’s a witch! 
And you’re just the ingredient to spice up her broth! 
Here she comes, fingertips crackling with magic. 
We can suggest some spells, if you wish. 
What will you say…

1. “Lord, have mercy!”
2. “Heads-a-Pop-Pop!”
3. “Mori Turpi Bestia!”
