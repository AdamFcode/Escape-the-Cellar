
Wake up, little one. 
Welcome to the Cellar. 
We know you did not choose to come here, but here you find yourself nonetheless.
Few have braved escape. 
Fewer still have succeeded. 
Most elect to remain in the dark and pray for the end. 
What will you choose? 

1. I need to escape this cellar!!
2. The dark is comfortingâ€¦
