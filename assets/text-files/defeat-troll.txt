You duck the club, grab its leg and climb! 
You reach its shoulders in no time. 
And place your head on its head. 
Almost lovingly. 
The troll screeches and takes aim. 
Swings its club. 
You dodge it… 
The troll’s skull does not! 
Its head pops into its body and it collapses.
Defeated! 
There little one, the exit. 
You must be quick.
