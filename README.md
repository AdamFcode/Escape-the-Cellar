# Escape the Cellar
Escape the Cellar is a python-based text adventure that challenges the user to escape a cellar that they have been imprisoned in by a formless entity. This entity serves as the narrator and leads the user through a sequence of challenges that require choices to be made by the user. The game has several points at which the user can "fail" and be offered the chance to try again. There are only two means of escaping, each requiring the user to successfully navigate through the choices until they reach the end.

# Preparation
In preperation for this project, multiple websites and videos were consulted, as well as several "text-adventure" books, particularly from the "Goosebumps" series. These were studied to get an intuitive understanding of how such adventures are typically constructed.

The flow of the adventure was planned out using Lucidchart, allowing for the two 'pathways' to be concisely illustrated. Provided in the relevant section below, this chart helped immensely in organising and visualising the flow of the project's functions and choices. 

Once the initial preparation was complete, potential "testers" were consulted in order to get an understanding of what they would expect from a text-adventure game.

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to play an interactive game that requires no downloads or installations
* As a user, I want to receive clear instructions and choices from the app
* As a user, I want my inputted data to be handled correctly and to return advancement in the "adventure"
* As a user, I want to be offered the chance to play again should I win or lose
* As a user, I want to replay the app and reasonably expect a varied experience

The above will be adressed under Testing below.

## LucidChart
LucidChart was selected to visualise the flow of the adventure and to provide a visual guide to reference when writing the code. The free version of LucidChart was used which limits the number of shapes the user has access to in any given document. As a result of this, some remaining shapes had to be manually placed later via MS Paint, which slightly upset the visual uniformity of the chart.
